                      These days, most people call me Rary. This is the part where I should tell you “what I do” but if we’re being honest – I don’t know. I’m a currently building data solutions as an engineer at <a href="https://rudderstack.com">RudderStack</a>. In my <i>“free time”</i> I run a cafe/bar with my wife called Mountain Goat that provides free outdoor trips and mentoring for kids from traditionally under-resourced communities. I’m also the founder and on the board of a non-profit called <a href="https://goatgvl.org">GOAT – Great Outdoor Adventure Trips</a>.
